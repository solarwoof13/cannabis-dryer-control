Standalone IR Receiver Test
Location: tests/ir_testing/test_ir_receiver.py

Tests the IR receiver module independently before integration.
This does NOT integrate with your existing cannabis dryer code.

WIRING FOR IR RECEIVER (3 wires):
===================================
DORHEA 38kHz IR Receiver Module:
Pins labeled: DAT, VCC, GND

RECOMMENDED WIRING (Start with 3.3V):
1. VCC  -> Connect to Raspberry Pi Pin 1 (3.3V) - Try this first!
2. GND  -> Connect to Raspberry Pi Pin 6 (Ground)
3. DAT  -> Connect to Raspberry Pi Pin 12 (GPIO 18)

NOTE: Module spec says 5V, but often works at 3.3V with reduced range.
      If 3.3V doesn't work, use Pin 2 (5V) with voltage divider!
      See IR_WIRING_GUIDE.md for voltage divider circuit.

Pin Layout Reference:
    Pin 1  (3.3V)   [X] [ ] Pin 2  (5V)
    Pin 3           [ ] [ ] Pin 4
    Pin 5           [ ] [X] Pin 6  (GND)
    Pin 7           [ ] [ ] Pin 8
    Pin 9           [ ] [ ] Pin 10
    Pin 11          [ ] [X] Pin 12 (GPIO 18)
    
This test will listen for IR signals and print them to the console.
